###########################
CSC Operations with Argo CD
###########################

`Argo CD`_ is the mechanism used to control the deployment configuration of some control system components to Kubernetes_.
The description of the control system architecture is given in `LSE-150 <https://ls.st/lse-150>`_.
The `SQuaRE RSP deployment introduction <https://phalanx.lsst.io/introduction.html>`_ has a good brief on the concepts of the deployment mechanism.
The deployment system uses Helm_ charts to control the delivered content to Kubernetes_.
The Helm_ charts are part of the application or linked from a shared directory if more than one application uses the same chart.
The `Argo CD`_ configuration and this documentation are stored in the `argocd-csc <https://github.com/lsst-ts/argocd-csc>`_ repository in GitHub_.

This deployment mechanism leverages many technologies provided by Data Management's `SQuaRE <https://github.com/lsst-sqre>`_ group.
This documentation bears heavy resemblance to theirs as many of the concepts and applications of methodologies are similar if not the same.

The following environments are managed by `Argo CD`_ using configuration in this repository.
The links are links to the `Argo CD`_ dashboards, which require authentication.
The names are the environment names used internally in this repository to name values files and for other purposes.

Application Maintenance
=======================

This section handles adding, upgrading and maintaining control system applications.
The actions described in this section require access to the `Argo CD`_ UIs or Kubernetes_ instances.
The UIs require credentials for access and those are stored in the Rubin Observatory IT's 1password system.
For the Kubernetes_ systems, the appropriate ``kubeconfig`` file can be obtained by the site specific Rancher instance.

Operations Guide
================

These sections describe some of the more important applications used in the deployment as well as how to bootstrap a new deployment.

Applications

The rest of the applications, except those listed in :ref:`CSC-Ops-with-ArgoCD-Collector-Apps`, are CSCs and are managed by an internal chart located in ``charts/csc``.

.. _CSC-Ops-with-ArgoCD-Collector-Apps:

Collector Applications
----------------------

These applications are what `Argo CD`_ calls an app of apps.
They are collections of child applications (CSCs, components or both) that are grouped into a particular namespace.
All collector applications, except ``love``, support running simulators for a CSC.
All simulators are specified by adding the CSC name to the ``isSim`` key.
The collector applications (except ``love``) also support renaming the default application name by providing a key, value pair via the ``renameMap`` key.
Further documentation on the options available can be found in the ``README.md`` in each collector application directory.
